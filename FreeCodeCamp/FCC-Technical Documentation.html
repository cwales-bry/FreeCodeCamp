                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                            and
                            its
                            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                            place
                            elements
                            on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                            navigation.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                            JavaScript on
                            a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                            database,
                            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                            perform
                            file
                            manipulations on a server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                    emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well
                    as
                    its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                    large-scale
                    projects.</p>
                <p> Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including
                    structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often
                    described
                    as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
                <p>Python continues to be one of the most commonly used programming languages and among the most popular
                    for
                    a variety of reasons.</p>

                <p>Today, there are about 700 programming languages in the world, but the list of truly notable ones is
                    rather short. JavaScript and Python are considered to be the two most popular programming languages,
                    and
                    software engineers constantly argue as to which one is better. Today, we’ll compare JavaScript and
                    Python and get to know where best to apply them. </p>
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>Python is one of the most popular and widely used general-purpose programming languages. It was
                    invented
                    in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum as an object-oriented programming language. It means that Python
                    developers build apps and websites with virtual building blocks (objects). Python and other
                    object-oriented programming languages provide developers with the ability to create virtual objects
                    that
                    can be given unique abilities and attributes. Such a model allows for reducing the complexity for
                    Python
                    developers as it mimicks real-world building frameworks and gives software engineers a clear
                    structure.

                <pre>
                    <code>
 if x < 5:
    print(x)
                </code>
                    </pre>
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>While Python is in essence an object-oriented programming language, JavaScript, on the other hand, is
                    a
                    scripting one. It means that JS basically tells computer programs (web applications, websites, etc.)
                    to
                    perform some action — to “do something.” Scripting languages automate app and website processes that
                    otherwise would need to be done by users. Without JS and other scripting languages, any updates on a
                    web
                    page that you visit would require you to manually reload it. Scripting is also responsible for all
                    the
                    animations, refreshing, adjusting, etc.</p>

            <article>
                <p>In computer programming, a variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated
                    symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value;
                    or in simpler terms, a variable is a container for a particular set of bits or type of data (like
                    integer, float, String etc...). A variable can eventually be associated with or identified by a
                    memory address. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to
                    referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content
                    allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in
                    computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus
                    change during the course of program execution. </p>

                    <p>
                        Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of variables in mathematics. The
                        latter is abstract, having no reference to a physical object such as storage location. The value of
                        a computing variable is not necessarily part of an equation or formula as in mathematics. Variables
                        in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their
                        use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in
                        transcription and manipulation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A variable's storage location may be referenced by several different identifiers, a situation known
                        as aliasing. Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value
                        that can be accessed through the other identifiers.
                    </p>

                    <p>Compilers have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a
                    variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be
                    changed during program execution. </p>

                    They do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
